            <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p><span></span>M.S. Dhoni, in full Mahendra Singh Dhoni, (born July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar [now Jharkhand] state, India), 
                Indian cricketer whose rise to prominence in the early 21st century culminated in his captaincy of the Indian national 
                team that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in 2011.</p>

                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand.
                             He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil,
                              Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>STARTS ODI CARRIER</h4>
                        <p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot 
                            didn't lack in batting talent.The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents
                             like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads. With Dhoni making a mark
                              in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.Dhoni did not have a great start 
                              to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.
                            In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>RETIREMENT </h4>
                        <p>He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014, and stepped down as captain of T20Is and ODIs in 2017.
                             On 15 August 2020, Dhoni retired from all formats of international cricket and continues to play in the IPL.</p>
